**Overview**

This program demonstrates how to handle a list containing multiple data types in Python and separate them into individual lists based on their type. The objective is to categorize elements like integers, floats, strings, booleans, and other data types from a single mixed list into distinct lists.


**Problem Statement**

Given a list of mixed data types (e.g., integers, floats, strings, booleans, etc.), the goal is to write a Python program that:

    *)Takes the input list containing various data types.
    *)Separates and categorizes each element into separate lists based on their specific type.
